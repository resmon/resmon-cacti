----[ Purpose

    This plugin analyzes many cacti db structures
    to determine unused rrd files.

----[ Features

    1) allows for filtering and sorting on
       - rrd file name
       - date/timestamp of last rrd file modification
       - size
    2) file delete is done by the poller
       This avoids permission errors or security issues.
       The same instance that creates rrd files, the poller,
       will be used for deletion as well.

----[ Prerequisites

    Before you install RRDCleaner, you need to have met the following pre-requisites:

    1) Cacti 0.8.6j or above

----[ Installation

    Install is similar to other plugins.
    Realm ID 36 is used for pre-PIA2.x. No sql import necessary

----[ Usage
